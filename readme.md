# Facebook Messenger Bot
This is a simple python template that uses Flask to build a webhook for Facebook's Messenger Bot API.
Read more in my [tutorial that uses this repository](https://tutorials.botsfloor.com/creating-your-messenger-bot-4f71af99d26b).

The aim is to create chatbot with some added features of virtual assistant.

**PS: Let me know if you want to contribute, I can add you as a tester to make the bot respond on your messages.**

## TODO:
- **Extend APIs**: Presently, it has been integrated with weather API only. Extend it to railway APIs for showing live train status, train between two stations, schedule and other stuffs.

- **0 understanding**: Unfortunately, most of the stuffs has been hard coded. Responses are being predicted on the basis of string matching. Integrate NLP APIs or self written codes to make conversation more realistic.

- **Schedule reminder**: This is more like your chatbot assistant. Extend the program to schedule a reminder for specific date and time and should ping the user accordingly with meaningful messages.
